VWorks BioShake plugin
===================

VWorks plugin for controlling Q.Instruments BioShake shakers.

This is a very simple plugin that effectively uses the [VWorks API](http://www.velocity11.com/techdocs/AutomationSolutionsDK/index.html), and thus a great starting point if you need a template for a new plugin.

* BioShake.dll from [here](https://github.com/nolanlab/VWorks-Bioshake/tree/master/Bioshake/bin/Release)
